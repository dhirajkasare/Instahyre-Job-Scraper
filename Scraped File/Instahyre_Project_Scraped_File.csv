First and foremost, the current cloud services in this space are, in our opinion, half-baked. Second, this is where the majority of the money is being spent today and will continue to be spent in the future. Third, we've been living and breathing this space for over 20 years and are confident in our ability to solve interesting problems.","Python

Gumlet,Data Science Engineer,Bangalore,Founded in 2019,10 - 50 employees,"Gumlet has built a new-age media delivery infrastructure that provides low code or no-code integration plugins that automate the entire media publishing pipeline. As the internet becomes increasingly global and data-hungry, serving images and video in a high-performance, low-latency environment is considered table-stakes for all websites to earn customer trust. Developers worldwide use Gumlet to automatically provide the lowest size images and videos with the best resolution and performance.

Media files such as images, GIFs, videos, and animations are integral to all digital interactions and experiences today. Yet, current solutions for managing and publishing media files typically rely on archaic APIs that require deep integration, domain knowledge, and constant maintenance. Today's med processing is messy and complicated, involving various formats, device sizes, and platforms.

With Gumlet, developers never have to worry about managing different versions and sizes of media files again. Once integrated, previous, new and upcoming images are all automatically optimised for all users. Gumlet takes over resize, compression, format conversion, transcoding, streaming, delivery, and analytics for all media files.

Due to the automation Gumlet provides, developers experience 30% to 50% better optimisation without affecting quality. This helps online businesses to provide better UX, load pages faster, save cloud costs and improve SEO.

Gumlet currently serves more than 6,000 customers, including online stores, news sites, blogs, EdTech startups, travel sites, and crowdfunding portals. Over four billion media files are delivered every week via Gumlet.

Gumlet was founded in 2019 in Singapore by Aditya Patadia & Divyesh Patel, who previously built, scaled, and successfully exited from turing analytics, a pioneering AI startup in the visual search space. Aditya is also the creator of a very popular open-source image resize library in PHP language, which he launched in 2012","Amazon SageMaker

Lifestyle diseases have become the order of the day. Unless we monitor our health issues, they may skyrocket impacting our vitality.

Our smart phone connected platform allows you to test for a wide range health conditions such as diabetes, cholesterol levels, hormonal changes, Vitamin levels, infections and STDs on a single device. The intelligently designed app analyses and tracks the values to help you achieve your health goals without making frequent inconvenient trips to the clinic. Our platform is powered by our patent pending technology that allows us to read any kind of test strip on a device as small as a Glucometer.

We have launched Inito with Ovulation Tracking, the first one in our suite of tests. Our platform has the potential to carry out 30 different tests in a single device.

Chalo,Quality Analyst,"Bangalore, Vasco Da Gama",Founded in 2014,50 - 200 employees,"Chalo is India's #1 bus transport technology company built with the core purpose of making travel better. With operations in 48 cities and powering over 15 million daily commutes every month, Chalo is solving a real-world problem that affects crores of Indians. And we are building India's largest mobility company along the way!
How large is the problem?
Buses are the single-largest mode of transport. They account for 48% of all public transport trips in India, and more in other countries. Compare this with 8% of trips on taxis, and just about 2% on metros. People in our country spend $20 billion on bus tickets annually. However, each bus commuter spends the equivalent of 8 days a year waiting for a bus and bus operators have losses running into hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
What are we solving?
We aim to make travel better for everyone. Today we do so by improving the experience of taking city buses. Chalo users wait 30 minutes less each day, travel safer with contactless digital tickets, and even save money with Chalo Super Saver plans. By adding reliability and convenience to the city bus system, we kick start a virtuous circle, where happier commuters mean more rides which in turn means more revenue for our bus operator partners, which means better services for commuters. Our most important KPI is the revenue uplift achieved. We have demonstrated an increase of up to 70% in bus ridership in Chalo cities, enabling some operators to be profitable for maybe the first time in this business.
How we do it
We work in partnership with bus operators to deploy our proprietary technology - GPS, Electronic ticketing devices, the Chalo App, the Chalo Card, and the entire back-end tech platform to support all this. By deploying an end-to-end solution, we are able to power a unique experience. Over time we have understood the value of expanding our scope of work as well as leveraging the power of the data generated by our platform to help operators with operations such as route optimization, crew management, and revenue maximization.
We have developed expertise for not just issuance of mobile tickets and closed loop cards, but also for accepting payments.","Automation Testing

Chalo,SDE 2 - Backend Developer,"Bangalore, Navi Mumbai, Panaji",Founded in 2014,50 - 200 employees,"Chalo is India's #1 bus transport technology company built with the core purpose of making travel better. With operations in 48 cities and powering over 15 million daily commutes every month, Chalo is solving a real-world problem that affects crores of Indians. And we are building India's largest mobility company along the way!
How large is the problem?
Buses are the single-largest mode of transport. They account for 48% of all public transport trips in India, and more in other countries. Compare this with 8% of trips on taxis, and just about 2% on metros. People in our country spend $20 billion on bus tickets annually. However, each bus commuter spends the equivalent of 8 days a year waiting for a bus and bus operators have losses running into hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
What are we solving?
We aim to make travel better for everyone. Today we do so by improving the experience of taking city buses. Chalo users wait 30 minutes less each day, travel safer with contactless digital tickets, and even save money with Chalo Super Saver plans. By adding reliability and convenience to the city bus system, we kick start a virtuous circle, where happier commuters mean more rides which in turn means more revenue for our bus operator partners, which means better services for commuters. Our most important KPI is the revenue uplift achieved. We have demonstrated an increase of up to 70% in bus ridership in Chalo cities, enabling some operators to be profitable for maybe the first time in this business.
How we do it
We work in partnership with bus operators to deploy our proprietary technology - GPS, Electronic ticketing devices, the Chalo App, the Chalo Card, and the entire back-end tech platform to support all this. By deploying an end-to-end solution, we are able to power a unique experience. Over time we have understood the value of expanding our scope of work as well as leveraging the power of the data generated by our platform to help operators with operations such as route optimization, crew management, and revenue maximization.
We have developed expertise for not just issuance of mobile tickets and closed loop cards, but also for accepting payments.","C

OptIQ.AI,DevOps Engineer - I,Bangalore,Founded in 2021,0 - 10 employees,"OptIQ is an AI platform that creates and secures a scalable, compliant infrastructure stack for startups. At its essence, DevOps involves closer collaboration and shared responsibility between development and operations for the products they create and maintain. It involves cultivating multidisciplinary teams who take accountability for the entire lifecycle of a product. They strive to communicate frequently, increase efficiencies, and improve the quality of services they provide to customers.

In a DevOps culture, typically the Ops team is defining how production monitoring, alerting, etc. work. Staging and development environments are typically monitored differently by developers themselves. With the NoOps culture in mind, we wanted to shift the full monitoring responsibility to the development teams, so that testing could happen in production, also known as shifting left. NoOps aims to improve productivity and deliver results much faster than DevOps. In the ideal scenario, developers never have to collaborate with a member of the operations team. Instead, they can use a set of tools and services to responsibly deploy the required cloud components securely, including both the code and infrastructure.","Docker

Inito,Data Science Intern (Internship),Bangalore,Founded in 2014,10 - 50 employees,"Inito is a medical technology startup based out of Bangalore, India. With relentless passion and technological acumen, we are developing remarkably smart medical devices that are not just accurate and reliable but also convenient and user-friendly. Our aim is to make your life easier when it comes to medical tests.

In today's age healthcare has taken a whole new meaning. With our lives becoming busier than ever, many of us are time starved to take care of our health. Lifestyle diseases have become the order of the day. Unless we monitor our health issues, they may skyrocket impacting our vitality. Unfortunately, existing medical devices are built to track only one condition each and they do not offer any data tracking and analytics to help you keep a tab on your health. We are often dependent on diagnostic clinics for tests which is not just expensive, but also inconvenient.

Inito is here to change this. Our smart phone connected platform allows you to test for a wide range health conditions such as diabetes, cholesterol levels, hormonal changes, Vitamin levels, infections and STDs on a single device. The intelligently designed app analyses and tracks the values to help you achieve your health goals without making frequent inconvenient trips to the clinic. Our platform is powered by our patent pending technology that allows us to read any kind of test strip on a device as small as a Glucometer.

We have launched Inito with Ovulation Tracking, the first one in our suite of tests. Our platform has the potential to carry out 30 different tests in a single device.

As a testimony to our work we have won 3 design awards - CII Design Award, India Design Mark and the prestigious Japanese Good Design Award.","Computer Vision

Gumlet,Lead Software Engineer,Work From Home,Founded in 2019,10 - 50 employees,"Gumlet has built a new-age media delivery infrastructure that provides low code or no-code integration plugins that automate the entire media publishing pipeline. As the internet becomes increasingly global and data-hungry, serving images and video in a high-performance, low-latency environment is considered table-stakes for all websites to earn customer trust. Developers worldwide use Gumlet to automatically provide the lowest size images and videos with the best resolution and performance.

Media files such as images, GIFs, videos, and animations are integral to all digital interactions and experiences today. Yet, current solutions for managing and publishing media files typically rely on archaic APIs that require deep integration, domain knowledge, and constant maintenance. Today's med processing is messy and complicated, involving various formats, device sizes, and platforms.

With Gumlet, developers never have to worry about managing different versions and sizes of media files again. Once integrated, previous, new and upcoming images are all automatically optimised for all users. Gumlet takes over resize, compression, format conversion, transcoding, streaming, delivery, and analytics for all media files.

Due to the automation Gumlet provides, developers experience 30% to 50% better optimisation without affecting quality. This helps online businesses to provide better UX, load pages faster, save cloud costs and improve SEO.

Gumlet currently serves more than 6,000 customers, including online stores, news sites, blogs, EdTech startups, travel sites, and crowdfunding portals. Over four billion media files are delivered every week via Gumlet.

Gumlet was founded in 2019 in Singapore by Aditya Patadia & Divyesh Patel, who previously built, scaled, and successfully exited from turing analytics, a pioneering AI startup in the visual search space. Aditya is also the creator of a very popular open-source image resize library in PHP language, which he launched in 2012","Web Scraping

Most candidates don't make it simply because they don't prepare well enough. Interview Kickstart (IK) helps candidates nail the toughest tech interviews.

At IK, current and former hiring managers at these top companies take candidates through an intense 2 month prep course to make them completely ready to crack the toughest interviews.

Wait, what?

Yup. Almost all of the growth came through word-of-mouth, with barely any SEO, content marketing or advertising. We know it sounds crazy, but it's true. That's how good our offering is.

But now that we know we have a great product, and are doing very well financially, it's time to start gunning the growth engine.","Django

Thus, a faster, economical and safe way which also reduces traffic and carbon footprint is the need of the hour.

Rapido is basically a platform where you can book a bike ride through a mobile app while traveling solo. The difference in economics of a two-wheeler and a four-wheeler allows you to save upto 60% of your ride cost when you're traveling solo. With the traffic situation exceptionally pathetic especially during peak hours, zipping past in a two-wheeler saves a lot of time. What's more is that it also provides an opportunity for people with a two-wheeler (along with the license) to become a rider on the platform and earn some extra money in their spare time.

We are transforming the way the world eats by making food more convenient and accessible. We give people the opportunity to eat what they want, when and where they want it. When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story.

Our journey began with our founder Will, arriving in London and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite living in one of the world's best cities for food. In 2013 he got on his bike and founded Deliveroo.

Fast forward to today and Deliveroo can be found in 11 markets, with over 100,000 riders delivering orders from over 140,000 restaurants and stores serving millions of customers in hundreds of cities worldwide.

There are so many questions we are working on and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do we give low income families access to affordable healthy meals? How do we tackle waste? How can we scale our network to tens of millions of orders a day? What does a future layout of a restaurant look like? How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we take what we know about a customer and offer a personalised selection?

At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

The size of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. Only 3% of the global food market is online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of other industries, such as travel (45%) and retail (10%), and it is clear we are at the very beginning of our journey. Despite being one of the world's fastest growing multi-billion dollar companies, we're only just getting started.

We hope you're as excited about the scale of the opportunity as we are and, if you share our ambition, that you'll join us and be part of this incredible story.","Golang

At Tessell, we aspire to Tessellate all types of enterprise data into the cloud. To begin with, we concentrate on structured data for three reasons. First and foremost, the current cloud services in this space are, in our opinion, half-baked. Second, this is where the majority of the money is being spent today and will continue to be spent in the future. Third, we've been living and breathing this space for over 20 years and are confident in our ability to solve interesting problems.","Python

Toplyne,Technical Lead,Bangalore,Founded in 2021,10 - 50 employees,"We're building a platform that sits over most commonly used applications, pulls in data from them, stitches it together, and provides business teams with a UI to identify PQLs (product qualified lead), run experiments and then send that data to a destination application of their choice. To begin with, we want people to use the platforms they are familiar with, and not displace a Salesforce, Hubspot and others. Long term, we believe the core CRM for PLG companies will look different to the CRMs that exist today, and will build towards that vision.

Businesses can use Toplyne to combine their intuition, with Toplyne's data insights, to build hypothesis on which users are ready for sales. Once done, these groups of users will be automatically qualified and sent to the destination application of choice.","Java
